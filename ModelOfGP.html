        <h4>Model of Good Pratice (MGP) in User Interface (UI)</h4>
        <h3>The construction of the design of this website started with a research in the a <a href="https://www.awwwards.com/">The WWW Awards</a> website, and there was two thigs that called my attention on the <a href="https://grette.no/en/">Grette</a> Website (one of the winners of the WWW award), it’s simplicity on design and the “hamburger” menu where things that I loved. This was the first step for me to start my sketches (these where the first bash of sketches, which I unfortunately lost, and won’t be able to show you) for the design and then start coding my website.</h3>

        <h3>After the first try of my website, I asked my friend, Henrique Mendes, for his opinion because I know he would tell me the truth and wouldn’t say stuff just to make me happy. After hearing his opinion, I realized that the way that I’ve done my website was one that I enjoyed myself, so, like a computer, I restarted everything from scratch, I redid the sketches.</h3>
        <h4>My First Attempt at the Website</h4>

        <h3>When I finished the new bash of sketches, I started coding again, and after I asked for my friend’s opinion again, I has getting somewhere, because finally I has doing something with the design that I like. But this time I draw on the sketches the “hamburger” menu, this was something that I didn’t knew how to do without Java, because one of my objectives for this website was to try not to use Java, so I wwnt to <a href="https://codepen.io/#">CodePen</a> to try and see if <a href="https://codepen.io/vinsongrant/pen/zrwxZE?depth=everything&order=popularity&page=5&q=hamburger&show_forks=false">someone (that someone called Grant Vinson)</a> was able to the menu that I wanted without using Java, and after a while I could see that someone did, so I decided to use their code on my website.</h3>
        <h3>To conclude, after finishing my website, I was proud of it, I did have to use someone else’s code, but in the end, I credited when credit was due. Still, I felt that I did a good job with my website, and I hope that whoever is reading this thinks the same.</h3>
