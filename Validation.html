        <h4> My Refletion of this website and my 'Site Validation'</h4>
        <h3>This first term with this assignment, I’ve had the pleasure of learning how to programme with HTML and CSS, this aloud me to be to create my own simple website. In the beginning I though this was would be rather easy, but has I started to do this assessment I realised that this would be an easy task, unless I would be to REALLY understand the code that I was writing.</h3>
        <h3>In the beginning to get some inspiration I went to <a href="https://www.awwwards.com/">The WWW Awards</a> website, so I would have an idea of to design my website after, and to be the website that got to see where completely spectacular, website with such amazing design and ground-breaking features. After doing this research, I started to do the sketches that you see below this paragraph, and after it I knew where to start with the programming of the website.</h3>

        <h3>After I finished the website, I felt proud of what I had done and, I started to think how much I had learn to do this assessment, and I felt so happy of thinking about how this learning experience would help me in the future. Although, I hope that whoever is reading this has enjoyed my website, and that it was helped you in case you want to try and code your own website or in case it has helped you trying to think of a design for your website.</h3>
        <h3>One this page, I only put one of the sketches that I did before starting doing this website, and again if you are trying to do your own website then I do recommend that you do a sketch or a wireframe of the design of the website. This will help give a perspective of what you’re going to do, so you can be more relaxed when doing your Website and not in panic.</h3>
        <h3>To finish this reflection, I would say that I’m grateful that I got to be have Web Development has a module of my course and for the experience that it has brought me.</h3>
