        <h4>Computing (Computer Systems Engineering)</h4>
        <h3>My (Joao Vasconcelos) computing specialisation is computer systems. Computer systems play an integral role in our society. From local, small scale systems to larger multi-national companies, this industry is key for making devices interact and enabling people to communicate quickly and securely. The computing industry impacts on the daily lives of millions of people, all with individual demands and requirements for the technology they use. This industry is growing and evolving, with new avenues of research emerging continually. You will learn all about the influences that computer technology has on the world while finding your place in the industry.</h3>
        <h3>The reason why I choose this course is because I’ve been in love with technology since I was a kid. When my dad got me and my brother the iPad 2, I was constantly thinking: “How did they do this”, “How many people took to make this”, “What do you need to know to be able to be part of a team that can-do stuff like this”, and more… Be aware that I was a kid when I thought about these thing, now I’m much more aware of the work behind, any product from any company. I still want to be part of team that work so well together that can make products that are able to change people lives, able to make them entertained or even able to do what they did to me, and inspire them do choose courses in computing.</h3>
