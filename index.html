          <h1>Name: Joao Henrique Gaspar Vasconcelos</h1>
          <h2>Course: Computing (Computer Systems Engineering)</h2>
          <h3>I’m an 18 years old Portuguese student living at the University of Northampton, UK. In my free time I mostly enjoy playing games or listening to music, if you don’t count computing. These two areas are something that I’m truly passionate about. Going back computing: this is something that I fell in love with because I always thought about the possibilities and wondered how far mankind could push technology, to help each other or to continuously change the world. This is what inspires me to be on this course.</h3>

          <h2>Course: Computing (Computer Systems Engineering)</h2>
          <h3>My name is Alex Ramsey; I’m twenty two years old and used to live in Bury St Edmunds Suffolk. My main hobby is scuba diving and I learnt and qualified as British Sub Aqua Club (BSAC) Ocean Diver in 2011. Diving has further developed my ability to work in a team and independently. I have always been really interested in Information and communication technology (ICT) and have acquired a considerable amount of knowledge and experience from my college studies and outside interests. This has been further clearly demonstrated by successful completion of both my BTEC and first year HND courses at Cirencester College, showing my real passion for the subject.</h3>

          <h2>Course: Computing (Computer Systems Engineering)</h2>
          <h3>My name is Mateusz Szatrowski, I live and study in England for over 12 years. As a person without specified hobby I used to spend most of my free time drawing, at the same time being a computer gamer, that’s where my journey started. At the time of my secondary education which has helped me acquire basic skills with programming and develop a good approach to computers, I was ambitious and enthusiastic person and had enormous satisfaction after building or creating things. During the course of my studies, IT piqued my attention and inspired me in my career decision. It introduced me to computer systems and has helped me explore the key concepts of Systems engineering making me curious and demanding to learn more.</h3>

          <h1>Video: South Australia Powerpack Project Celebration</h1>
          <h2> Video Copyrights: Tesla®</h2>
          <h3>One of the main factors that lead me (Joao Vasconcelos) to choose Computing as a course, was the company Tesla® whose primary objective is to make the whole world electric (with this I mean trying to make everyone drive electric cars), so that us and the next generation can live in a “clean” (atmosphere clean) Earth. Now the reason why they are an inspiration to me is that it shows that engineers can help, or I even would go has far to say, that they can change the world. <p> Now back to video, tesla made this video in celebration of reaching a major milestone in the South Australian Powerpack® Project, they held an event to showcase the progress to date, with the entire event powered by the Powerpacks® that had been installed.</h3>
